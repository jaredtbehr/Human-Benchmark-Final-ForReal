Using a fast computer and low latency / high framerate monitor will improve your score.\n\nScores in this test are faster than the aim trainer test, because you can react instantly without moving the cursor.\n\nThis is discussed in further detail on the statistics page. While an average human reaction time may fall between 200-250ms, your computer could be adding 10-50ms on top. Some modern TVs add as much as 150ms!\n\nIf you want, you can keep track of your scores, and see your full history of reaction times.\nJust perform at least 5 clicks and then save.",
